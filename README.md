Project goal: Create an app that tracks movement throughout a laboratory and find a more efficient way to place lab equipment

In our process, we developed an IoT application to actively track movement throughout a laboratory, sending the information directly to a computer with an algorithm to calculate efficiency. The computer then gives out the efficiency of the lab equipment placement, letting the user know that there are more efficient setups for the equipment.  We used Red Hat in order to transfer the information between the phone and computer.

In later iterations, including the specific placements of the equipment will be an optimal feature, as well as accounting for structures in the middle of the room, as opposed to having a seemingly open floor plan.
